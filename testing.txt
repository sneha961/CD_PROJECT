After researching a major in computer engineering and computer science, I found that this is a very prestigious major to have, especially if you obtain a Masters
or Doctorate degree. At the University of Louisville, a Masters degree in computer engineering and computer science can be attained in five years through the 
Speed Scientific School. However, Speed School requires a demanding list of courses, such as several semesters of calculus, chemistry, physics, and programming. 
However, the completion of Speed School is guaranteed to pay off after graduation. 
The beginning salary for someone between the ages of 20 and 24 without a Masters degree is $56,000. The average beginning salary for someone with a Masters degree in
computer engineering begins at around $70,000. The average for a Masters in CECS is around $80,000, and for a Doctorate in this major the average is around $98,000.
The jobs require and understanding of optoelectronics, analog and wireless design, mathematics, and programming language such as C,C++, and Java. The places and 
companies that hire computer engineers include companies such as IBM, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, and many other companies that are directly related to 
computers. Other jobs that arent directly related with computers include the government organizations, such as the Department of Justice, the Navy, and Army. 
NASA also hires those with degrees in computer engineering and computer science.
At times, I am not sure if I want to continue with Speed School, but when I look into the future and see all the benefits that completing Speed School will 
provide me with, it makes me realize that I want to stick with it.
